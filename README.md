# Advent of Code

My solutions for Advent of Code year-over-year.

The intent is to use a unique language each year, as I view Advent of Code
as an excuse to try new things each.

Happy Holidays!

## Solutions

### 2025

I lied, 2025 is my first *real* attempt given I am actually participating during
the holiday season as the question release. This year, I am taking a stab at Golang!

### 2024

2024 was my first stab at Advent of Code, I decided to use JavaScript. I've
played around with PowerShell, Python, .NET, and Java over the years - but in a
JavaScript infested reality, have 0 experience only hurts me, it's time!
